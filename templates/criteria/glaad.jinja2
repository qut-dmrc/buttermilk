## Transgender People
    
Please see Glossary of Terms: Transgender for more tips on how to create stories about transgender people. If you are seeking information about how to create transgender and nonbinary characters for film, TV, theater, video games, etc., please read GLAAD’s TRANSform Hollywood guide. More resources for content creators may be found at glaad.org/transgender.

It is difficult to estimate the number of transgender people in the United States, as most surveys are not constructed in a way that can accurately capture that information. UCLA’s Williams Institute estimates there are 1.4 million transgender people in the United States. Certain surveys suggest that the Williams Institute estimate is far too low. However, if that number is accurate, and all transgender people in the US lived together in one place, that city would be America’s eighth largest city. But according to a 2021 Gallup poll, only 31% of Americans say they have friends or relatives or coworkers who have told them personally that they are transgender, compared to a 2013 Pew poll showing that 87% of Americans say they personally know someone who is gay or lesbian. If a stereotypical or defamatory image of a gay or lesbian person appears in the media, viewers can compare it to real people they know. But when a stereotypical or defamatory image of a transgender person appears in the media, the vast majority of viewers have no real-life comparison and may assume it is accurate. Therefore it is critical that media create stories about transgender people that are fair, accurate, and current.

### Social issues facing transgender people

**Transgender people face high levels of violence, discrimination, and poverty.** According to the U.S. Trans Survey, the largest national survey of transgender people to date, the trans community experiences unemployment at twice the rate of the general population, with rates for trans people of color up to four times the national unemployment rate. Transgender people are also four times more likely to live in poverty. Ninety percent of trans people report experiencing harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination on the job. The American Medical Association has stated that transgender people face an “epidemic of violence.” Transgender people face barriers in accessing healthcare, including anti-trans bias and laws allowing providers to deny care to trans patients. All of these realities result in transgender people, especially trans women and trans people of color, experiencing extremely high levels of minority stress that results in poor mental and physical health. According to the U.S. Trans Survey, 40% of transgender respondents reported attempting suicide, compared to 4.6% of the population as a whole. You can find more statistics from the U.S. Trans Survey here. A new U.S. Trans Survey is being launched in February 2022 and the results are expected by the end of 2022.

**Transgender people face growing backlash.** The growing visibility of transgender people and  more authentic media portrayals have led to a greater awareness of what it means to be a transgender person. This has led to significant policy changes which have brought greater equality for people who are trans, including the 2020 U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock. That landmark decision — in a case brought by, among others, transgender plaintiff Aimee Stephens — found that Title VII’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. However, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision extending full marriage equality to same-sex couples in 2015, anti-LGBTQ activists began to aggressively shift toward targeting transgender people, and especially transgender youth, as a wedge issue to advance their agenda. In February, 2021, the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Heritage Foundation, in coalition with other anti-trans activist groups, released their so-called “Promise to America’s Children.” This document is the blueprint for anti-trans bills introduced in legislatures across the country. In 2021, more than 140 bills were proposed in over 30 state legislatures targeting transgender youth and their access to healthcare and education. This concerted political tactic, combined with increasing anti-trans activism from some white cisgender women in the U.K., (given a significant platform by British author J.K. Rowling), is creating an even more hostile and toxic culture in the U.S. and worldwide for people who are transgender. This makes fair and accurate reporting even more important. **For more information about the backlash facing trans people, see Nondiscrimination, Healthcare, Hate Crimes, Youth, and Sports.**

### Names and Pronouns
    
**Always use a transgender person’s chosen name.** Some transgender people are able to obtain a legal name change from a court. However, many transgender people cannot afford a legal name change or are not yet old enough to legally change their name. They should be afforded the same respect for their chosen name as anyone else who uses a name other than their birth name (e.g., Lady Gaga, Demi Moore, Cardi B). When writing about a transgender person’s chosen name, do not say “she wants to be called,” “she calls herself,” “she goes by Marisol,” or other phrases that cast doubt on a transgender person’s gender. Do not put quotation marks around either a transgender person’s chosen name (or the pronoun) that reflects that person’s gender identity.

**Disclosing birth names.** When a transgender person’s birth name is used in a story, the implication is almost always that it is the person’s “real name.” But in fact, a transgender person’s chosen name is their real name, whether or not they are able to obtain a court-ordered name change, which can be expensive and involves complex bureaucratic obstacles. Some transgender people call it “deadnaming” when a trans person’s birth name is revealed without their permission, but the term is not universally accepted as it implies a trans person “dies” when they transition. If the person is not able to answer questions about their birth name, err on the side of caution and do not report it.

**Ask for the pronoun a person uses, and use it.** We all use pronouns, and pronouns convey gender information. If you say “He went to the store” and “She went to work,” your audience understands you to say that a man went to the store and a woman went to work. Cisgender people rarely think about pronouns because the gendered pronoun people use for them is aligned with the sex they were assigned at birth. However, for transgender people, social transition may involve asking others to refer to them with new and different pronouns in order to better reflect their true gender identity. Simply respect the pronouns people ask you to use and use them as requested, just as you would strive to pronounce someone’s name correctly. If you are not certain which pronoun to use, you might say to a person, “My pronouns are she/her. What pronouns do you use?” Or it is also acceptable to use the singular they to describe someone when you don’t wish to assign a gender. For example: “I haven’t met your friend Miguel. What pronouns do they use?” **Please note that the trans community no longer uses the phrase “preferred pronouns” as it implies that trans people’s pronouns are a preference, not a fact.** Accurate pronouns are important for transgender and nonbinary youth. Research from the Trevor Project shows that youth who reported having their correct pronouns used by the people they lived with had half the rate of attempted suicide compared to those who did not have their pronouns respected.

**Many nonbinary people use the singular *they* pronoun.** It is increasingly common for people who have a nonbinary gender identity and/or gender expression to use they/them as their pronoun. The singular they/them pronoun does not have gendered connotations. For example: “Devin writes eloquently about their nonbinary identity. They have also appeared frequently in the media to talk about their gender expression and the way people react to the way they dress.” The singular they has been adopted in all leading style guides, including AP, APA, MLA, and Chicago, and now appears in many dictionaries as well.

Some people may use both a gendered pronoun and they/them. For example, “My name is Jose and I use he/they pronouns.” People who use multiple pronouns may wish you to choose one of those pronouns and use it consistently, or they may wish you to use both pronouns interchangeably when referring to them. For example, “Jose is an excellent co-worker. He always turns in projects on deadline, and they also volunteer to organize the office holiday party every year.” (For more about what it means to be nonbinary, please see “In Focus: Nonbinary People.”)

**Neopronouns and honorifics**
Other pronouns like ze/zim and xe/xir exist and some nonbinary people use them. Sometimes they will use them together with they/them, depending on the situation and who they are talking to. Sometimes they will use neopronouns online or in written documents, but not when speaking. The honorifics Mr., Mrs., and Ms. are all gendered. Nonbinary people may ask for the gender-neutral honorific Mx. or ask that no honorific be used.

**If it is not possible to ask a transgender person which pronoun they use, use the pronoun that is consistent with the person’s gender expression.** Unfortunately, transgender people are subjected to extreme levels of violence and they may not be alive to tell you what pronouns they used. Transgender women are routinely misgendered in death by police and reporters. If a trans person used the name Kiara and her gender expression was feminine, then use she/her pronouns to refer to her. See GLAAD’s guide Doubly Victimized: Reporting on Transgender Victims of Crime for tips on how to report respectfully about a trans person who is no longer able to speak for themselves.

### Basics of writing a transgender story
**Respectful and accurate language is important.** Using accurate terminology is the first step toward creating a respectful story about transgender people. The Glossary of Terms: Transgender section of this guide offers definitions of basic terms and a list of defamatory and offensive terms to avoid. If possible, you should always ask for and use the name, pronouns and language that your interview subject uses to describe themselves.

**How to describe the fact that someone is transgender.** Transgender should always be used as an adjective. For example, “Marisol is a transgender woman.” If your audience needs clarification about what that phrase means, you can explain that “Marisol was designated male at birth, and began her transition 15 years ago.” Avoid “Marisol was born a man.” People are born babies and a doctor assigns a sex to an infant based on a quick look at the baby’s external anatomy. A transgender person’s gender identity is not determined by the sex they were assigned at birth. An oversimplification like “born a man” invalidates the current, authentic gender of the person you’re speaking about and is considered disrespectful.

**Avoid “identifies as” language.** Language within the trans community is evolving rapidly. Even a few years ago, trans people might have said “Marisol identifies as a woman.” However, the trans community is moving away from this language and some now even consider it offensive. You wouldn’t say that a man who used to date women and now dates men “identifies as” gay. You’d simply say that he is gay. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is an innate trait that cannot be changed. When a trans person reveals their true, authentic gender identity, it’s not a question of “identifying as” a woman or a man or as nonbinary — they simply are a woman or a man or a nonbinary person.

**Move beyond the transition narrative.** People who have just disclosed publicly that they are transgender are considered newsworthy, but they are often not ready for media attention nor are they ready to speak about larger issues facing a diverse transgender community. Furthermore, constantly focusing on transition is reductive because it conveys the impression that transition is the only interesting thing about transgender people. Finally, the “coming out” or “transition narrative” has been covered thoroughly since trans woman Christine Jorgensen made worldwide headlines in 1952. Just as coverage of the LGB community now focuses on many different aspects of being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, the media is encouraged to look for stories about transgender people that go beyond “When did you know?” and “What surgeries have you had?”

**Avoid focusing on medical transition.** It is inappropriate to ask a transgender person questions about their genitals or other surgeries they may or may not have had. Typically, those questions are only asked out of prurient curiosity. They also distract the journalist and the audience from seeing the whole person, and from focusing on important issues that affect transgender people like discrimination, poverty, and violence.

**Avoid sensationalized images or headlines.**  In almost every instance it is unnecessary to show “before and after” transition pictures of the person being profiled. Often these images are included simply to satisfy the invasive curiosity of readers or viewers. In most cases, they add nothing substantive to the story and only sensationalize the trans person’s life. Similarly, avoid clichéd images of transgender women putting on make-up, wigs, or panty hose, and shots of transgender men shaving. These type of photos imply that being transgender is simply a superficial, external performance of gender. Being transgender is not about physical appearance. Headlines and other promo copy should never resort to clichés or offensive language, simply in the interest of brevity or potential search engine optimization (SEO).. It is easy to ruin a well-written, nuanced story with a sensationalistic headline. Avoid phrases like “sex change” or “born a man” in headlines, subheads, promo copy, and stories.

**Bring in expert opinion.** Be cautious of inviting non-transgender guests to talk about transgender people, rather than talking to transgender people themselves. Journalists should seek transgender voices for stories about transgender lives and issues, especially when reporting on legislation affecting them, and ask lawmakers proposing these bills if they have consulted transgender constituents and medical professionals (every major medical association supports gender affirming care as effective, safe and lifesaving). Transgender people are the experts to talk about their own personal experiences. However, not every transgender person is an expert on every issue facing the trans community. When there is a policy issue or a campaign that affects transgender people, consider interviewing trans people who have leadership roles in the community and who are fully prepared to discuss the issue in depth. You do not always need a medical or psychological “expert” to speak about transgender people, but if you’d like a medical or psychological perspective, there are many transgender doctors and psychologists who can speak with experience and credible authority.

**Integrate transgender people into all stories.** While it is true that there are many social issues that must be addressed before transgender people are treated equally, it is also true that transgender people live day-to-day lives just like everyone else. Transgender people can be booked to talk about issues that are not about being trans and/or nonbinary. If you are doing a story about women in tech or Mother’s Day, consider including a transgender woman with children in those stories. If you are doing a story about pet adoption or Father’s Day, considering including a transgender man in those stories. If you are doing a story about entrepreneurs or Grandparent’s Day, consider including a nonbinary transgender person. When being transgender is just one of the many traits that make someone unique, we will move closer to full acceptance.

# Glossary of Terms: Transgender

In order to understand many of the terms used by transgender and nonbinary people, it is necessary to understand the difference between sex at birth, gender, identity, and gender expression – and how those three things are not the same as sexual orientation. Therefore, those four terms are defined first, and then additional terminology used by trans and nonbinary people follows.

## Core Concepts

### Sex at Birth
Infants are assigned a sex at birth, "male" or "female," based on the appearance of their external anatomy, and an M or an F is written on the birth certificate. However, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. As many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait. Furthermore, a person's body can be changed through medical transition in ways that fundamentally alter the sex they were assigned at birth.

### Gender Identity
A person's internal, deeply held knowledge of their own gender. Everyone has a gender identity. For most people their gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth. For transgender people, their gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. Many people have a gender identity of man or woman (or, for children, boy or girl). For other people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two binary genders. Please note: gender identity is not visible to others. You cannot look at someone and "see" their gender identity.

### Gender Expression
External manifestations of gender, expressed through a person's name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, voice, and/or behavior. Societies classify these external cues as masculine and feminine, although what is considered masculine or feminine changes over time and varies by culture. Most transgender people seek to align their gender expression with their gender identity to resolve the incongruence between their knowledge of their own gender and how the world "sees" them.

### Sexual Orientation
Do not confuse and conflate sexual orientation and gender identity. They are not the same. Sexual orientation describes a person's enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person. Gender identity is a person's innate understanding of their own gender. Like everyone else, transgender people have sexual orientations; they may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, asexual, etc. For example, a transgender woman who is attracted exclusively to women would typically call herself a lesbian; if she were exclusively attracted to men, she would likely call herself a straight woman. A transgender man who is attracted exclusively to men would typically call himself a gay man; if he were exclusively attracted to women, he would likely call himself a straight man. A transgender person who is attracted to more than one gender will likely call themself bisexual or pansexual.

## Common Terms

### Cisgender
An adjective used to describe people who are not transgender. "Cis-" is a Latin prefix meaning "on the same side as," and is therefore an antonym of "trans-." A cisgender person is a person whose gender identity is aligned with the sex they were assigned at birth. Currently, cisgender is a word not widely understood by most people, however, it is commonly used by younger people and transgender people. If you use cisgender in a news article, it is important to define what it means first, or you can simply say non-transgender people. Cisgender can be shortened to cis. We recommend only using the shorthand after you have used and defined the word cisgender for your audience. Note: Cisgender does not have a hyphen, nor does it need an "-ed" at the end.

### Transgender
An adjective to describe people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. People who are transgender may also use other terms, in addition to transgender, to describe their gender more specifically. Some of those terms are defined below. Use the term(s) the person uses to describe their gender. It is important to note that being transgender is not dependent upon physical appearance or medical procedures. A person can call themself transgender the moment they realize that their gender identity is different than the sex they were assigned at birth.

### Trans
Used as shorthand for transgender, and on second reference after first using the word transgender. If you use trans without defining it, or without the first reference of transgender, mainstream audiences may not understand its meaning or what you are referencing.

### Transition
Transition is the process a person undertakes to bring their gender expression and/or their body into alignment with their gender identity. It is a complex process that occurs over a long period of time and the exact steps involved in transition will vary from person to person. Transition can include:

- **Social transition** – Telling family, friends, and co-workers, using a different name, using different pronouns, dressing differently, starting or stopping wearing make-up and jewelry, etc
- **Legal transition** – Changing your name and/or sex marker on documents like a driver's license, passport, Social Security record, bank accounts, etc.
- **Medical transition** – Hormone replacement therapy and/or one or more surgical procedures.

These steps may also be referred to as gender affirming care. It is important to note that being transgender is not dependent upon physical appearance or medical procedures. A person can call themself transgender the moment they realize that their gender identity is different than the sex they were assigned at birth. Some transgender people may not feel they need to take any transition steps at all, while other trans people may wish to transition but cannot due to cost, underlying medical conditions, and/or fear of consequences from transphobic family, employers, etc. Avoid the phrase "sex change."

### Transgender Man
A man who was assigned female at birth may use this term to describe himself. He may shorten it to trans man. (Note: trans man, not "transman.") Some may prefer to simply be called men, without any modifier. Use the term the person uses to describe their gender.

### Transgender Woman
A woman who was assigned male at birth may use this term to describe herself. She may shorten it to trans woman. (Note: trans woman, not "transwoman.") Some may prefer to simply be called women, without any modifier. Use the term the person uses to describe their gender.

### Nonbinary People
Nonbinary is an adjective used by people who experience their gender identity and/or gender expression as falling outside the binary gender categories of "man" and "woman." Many nonbinary people also call themselves transgender and consider themselves part of the transgender community. Others do not. Nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses many different ways to understand one's gender. Some nonbinary people may also use words like agender, bigender, demigender, pangender, etc. to describe the specific way in which they are nonbinary. Always ask people what words they use to describe themselves. Nonbinary is sometimes shortened to enby. Do not use NB, as that is often shorthand for non-Black. Nonbinary may also be written as non-binary. Both forms are commonly used within the community and both are acceptable.

### Gender Non-Conforming
A term used to describe people whose gender expression differs from conventional expectations of masculinity and femininity. Please note that many cisgender people have gender expressions that are gender non-conforming. Simply having a non-conforming gender expression does not make someone trans or nonbinary. Nor are all transgender people gender non-conforming. Many transgender people have gender expressions that are conventionally masculine or feminine. Do not describe someone as gender non-conforming simply because they happen to be a transgender person. (May also be abbreviated as GNC.)

## Additional Concepts

### Drag Performance
A common misperception is that drag queens are always gay men who dress as women to put on a show and after the show they return to dressing and living as gay cisgender men. While many drag queens are gay cisgender men, drag shows have always included transgender women and other gender diverse people as performers. Some of these trans performers may have begun their careers perceived as gay men, and they were drawn to drag culture because it was one of the few places where their femininity was accepted and even celebrated. After understanding that they are trans women, many of these performers may choose to continue performing in drag shows for various reasons including financial reasons and because it was where they made friends and community. Prior to the community's adoption of the word transgender, these women may have called themselves female impersonators or showgirls.

Today, drag performance is more popular than ever, and the term drag artist is being used to recognize that drag is an art form that is open to everyone. Transgender women, cisgender women, transgender men, and nonbinary people all perform as drag queens. Drag king shows have also existed for a long time, but without the mainstream visibility of drag queen shows. In drag king shows, performers dress in masculine drag and portray male characters.

Unfortunately, many people continue to confuse and conflate drag queens with all trangender women who are often inaccurately described as "men in dresses." Most transgender woman have never performed in drag or been a part of that community, and they are therefore frustrated when people conflate their lives as women with drag shows performed as entertainment. Transgender women are women — and unless they are onstage performing in a drag show, they are not drag queens.

### Culturally specific terms for gender diversity
Throughout history and in cultures around the world, there have been words to describe people who live as a gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth. When talking to people from other countries or to people in the U.S. from certain cultures, you may hear words that describe a gender diverse experience. For example:

- South Asian: hijra community
- Samoa: fa'afafine
- Native Hawaiian: māhū
- Oaxaca (southern Mexico): muxe
- Indigenous/First Nations: Two-spirit, wíŋkte, nádleeh, ininiikaazo, etc.
- Judaism: androgynos, tumtum, ay'lonit, saris (four genders in addition to man and woman)

It is important to be aware of the cultural specificity of these terms. People from these cultures may default to calling themselves trans men and trans women when they are outside their own cultural context, but they will use the culturally specific term when they are among those who understand its meaning. It is also important to acknowledge that many indigenous traditions of gender diverse people were criminalized or eradicated by colonizers. Work continues in those cultures to remember and revive pre-colonial traditions, and undo the stigma, criminal laws, and harm created by colonizers. In many Western cultures, gender diversity has either been distorted by observer bias or erased from history books completely. This erasure feeds the false anti-trans ideology that being transgender and/or nonbinary is a new phenomenon. It is not.

## Other Terms

You may hear the following terms when doing research on transgender issues or speaking to an interview subject. Some of these terms are outdated and should be used with caution, unless they are in a direct quote. Some of them are terms that should only be used if your story is specifically about a certain topic (e.g. medical transition or health insurance.)

### Transsexual
An older term that originated in the medical and psychological communities. As the gay and lesbian community rejected homosexual and replaced it with gay and lesbian, the transgender community rejected transsexual and replaced it with transgender. Some people within the trans community may still call themselves transsexual. Do not use transsexual to describe a person unless it is a word they use to describe themself. If the subject of your news article uses the word transsexual to describe themself, use it as an adjective: transsexual woman or transsexual man.

### Cross-dresser
An older term that replaced the offensive word "transvestite." While anyone may wear clothes associated with a different sex, the term cross-dresser is typically used to refer to men who occasionally wear clothes, makeup, and accessories culturally associated with women, but who do not wish to transition and present as a woman at all times. This activity is not drag. It is a form of gender expression and not done for entertainment purposes. Be aware of the differences between cross-dressers, drag queens, and transgender women. Cross-dresser does not describe men who perform in drag as drag queens. Transgender women are not cross-dressers and should never be referred to as such.

### Gender Dysphoria
In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) which replaced the outdated entry "Gender Identity Disorder" with Gender Dysphoria, and changed the criteria for diagnosis. The necessity of a psychiatric diagnosis remains controversial, as both psychiatric and medical authorities recommend individualized medical treatment through hormone replacement therapy and/or surgeries to treat gender dysphoria. Some transgender advocates believe the inclusion of Gender Dysphoria in the DSM is necessary in order to obtain health insurance that covers the medically necessary treatment recommended for transgender people. Do not characterize being transgender as a mental disorder. Neither the American Psychiatric Association nor the American Psychological Association consider being transgender a "mental disorder."

In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), published by the World Health Organization, there is no entry for gender dysphoria in the mental health section. Instead, the ICD-11 has an entry for Gender Incongruence in the sexual health section. Gender incongruence is "characterised by a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual's experienced gender and the assigned sex, which often leads to a desire to transition, in order to live and be accepted as a person of the experienced gender, through hormonal treatment, surgery, or other health care services to make the individual's body align, as much as desired and to the extent possible, with the experienced gender." The United States is expected to adopt the ICD-11 in 2025.

### Gender Confirmation Surgeries (GCS)
Medical transition involves bringing a person's body into alignment with their gender identity and is only one part of transition. One type of medical transition is hormone replacement therapy, prescribed by a doctor. Gender confirmation surgeries can be another part of medical transition. Not all transgender people choose to, are physically healthy enough to, of can afford to undergo surgeries. Replaces the outdated and offensive phrase "sex reassignment surgery." Do not refer to someone as being "pre-op" or "post-op." Journalists should avoid focusing on surgeries. Unless the story is specifically about medical transition or policies related to healthcare access for transgender people, it is not relevant to the story.

### TERF and Gender Critical
Terms used to describe anti-trans activists who seek to limit full equality for transgender people and exclude trans women from women's spaces. The term TERF is an acronym for "Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist." Coined in 2008, the word describes a particular type of ideology which existed well before the invention of the word. Anti-trans activist and author Janice Raymond articulated many of these same transphobic claimsin her 1979 book The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male. Recently anti-trans activists have argued that TERF is a slur and have adopted the euphemism "gender critical" to describe their beliefs.

## Terms to Avoid

### "born a man," "born a woman," "biologically male," "biologically female," "biological boy," "biological girl," "genetically male," "genetically female"

**Why avoid:** Phrases like those above oversimplify a complex subject and are often used by anti-transgender activists to inaccurately imply that a trans person is not who they say they are. "Biological boy" is a term anti-trans activists often use to disregard and discredit transgender girls and deny them access to society as their authentic gender identity. As mentioned above, a person's sex is determined by a number of factors – and a person's biology does not determine a person's gender identity.

**Best practice:** These terms should be avoided in favor of a person's actual gender identity, for example: girl, woman, transgender girl, transgender woman, boy man, transgender boy, transgender man.

When describing a person's gender in relation to their assigned sex at birth, the terms cisgender, transgender, and/or nonbinary will usually be sufficient.

If there is a clear reason to refer to someone's birth sex, the terms to use are: assigned male at birth, assigned female at birth, or designated male at birth, designated female at birth.

### "transgenders," "a transgender"

**Why avoid:** Transgender should be used as an adjective, not as a noun. Do not say, "Tony is a transgender," or "The parade included many transgenders." Do not write "transwoman" or "transman." Do not capitalize transgender, unless it begins a sentence or is part of a name (e.g., National Center for Transgender Equality).

**Best practice:** transgender people, a transgender person

For example, "Tony is a transgender man," or "The parade included many transgender people." "Marisol is a trans woman" or "Mason is a trans man" or "Julio is a nonbinary transgender person"

### "transgendered"

**Why avoid:** The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous "-ed" tacked onto the end. An "-ed" suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. Not using the "-ed" suffix also brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer. You would not say that Elton John is "gayed" or Ellen DeGeneres is "lesbianed," therefore you would not say Laverne Cox is "transgendered." (Similarly, cisgender never needs an "-ed" at the end.)

**Best practice:** transgender

### "transgender individuals" "a transgender individual"

**Why avoid:** Referring to people who are trans as "individuals" contributes to dehumanizing them.

**Best practice:** transgender people, transgender person

### "Identifies as"

**Why avoid:** Avoid saying that transgender people "identify as" their gender. That implies that gender identity is a choice. Avoid "Marisol identifies as a woman."

**Best practice:** Transgender people are their gender the same way cisgender people are their gender. For example, "Marisol is a transgender woman."

### "transgenderism" "gender ideology"

**Why avoid:** These are not terms used by transgender people. These terms are used by anti-transgender activists to dehumanize transgender people and reduce who they are to "a condition" or a "dangerous ideology" that threatens "free speech."

**Best practice:** Refer to being transgender instead, or refer to the transgender community. You can also refer to the movement for transgender equality and acceptance.

### "female-to-male" "male-to-female"

**Why avoid:** This language is outdated. It implies someone is changing their gender from one binary gender to the other binary gender. In reality, the person's gender is an innate sense of self that has not changed.

**Best practice:** transgender man, transgender woman, transgender person

### "sex change," "pre-operative," "post-operative"

**Why avoid:** Referring to a "sex-change operation," or using terms such as "pre-operative" or "post-operative," inaccurately suggests that a person must have surgery in order to transition. Avoid overemphasizing surgery when discussing transgender people or the process of transition.

**Best practice:** transition

### "Preferred pronouns"

**Why avoid:** Briefly the trans and nonbinary community did use this phrase. However, it began to seem as if cisgender people had pronouns, while trans people had "preferred pronouns." Everyone uses pronouns and they are a fact, not a preference.

**Best practice:** Simply say pronouns. As in "Please consider putting your pronouns in your email signature," or "I use he/him. What pronouns do you use?"

### "Transgender rights"

**Why avoid:** People who are transgender and/or nonbinary are not asking for rights that are different from the rights everyone has. They are simply seeking full equality under the law and an end to discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression. Community members and allies may use the phrase "trans rights" or "transgender rights." However, media should be aware that anti-trans activists weaponize phrases like "trans rights" "gay rights"' and "special rights" in order to imply that LGBTQ people are demanding more or different protections and "rights" than cisgender, straight people already have.

**Best practice:** Equality and acceptance for people who are transgender. Transgender people are advocating to be treated equally.

### "passing" and "stealth"

**Why avoid:** While some transgender people may use these terms among themselves, it is not appropriate to repeat them in mainstream media unless it is in a direct quote. The terms refer to a transgender person's ability to go through daily life without others making an assumption that they are transgender. However, the terms themselves are problematic because "passing" implies "passing as something you are not," while "stealth" connotes deceit. When transgender people are living as their authentic selves, and are not perceived as transgender by others, that does not make them deceptive.

**Best practice:** Perceived as transgender, not perceived as transgender, perceived as cisgender

## Examples

**Avoid:** "Marisol was born a man but identifies as a woman."  
**Best Practice:** "Marisol is a transgender woman."

**Best Practice:** "John's coworkers didn't know that he is a trans man."

**Avoid:** "The clinic offers gynecological services for female-to-male patients."

**Avoid:** "The story is about a teenager who transitions from male to female in high school."  
**Best Practice:** "The story is about a teenage trans girl who transitions in high school."

**Avoid:** "Beth grew up male and became a woman at age 25."  
**Best Practice:** "When Beth was younger, she was perceived to be male by others. At age 25, she disclosed that she is a trans woman and began her transition."

**Avoid:** "The school board dismissed the parents' complaint that Imani, a transgender girl, was participating in school athletics with biological females."  
**Best Practice:** "The school board dismissed the parents' complaint that Imani, a transgender girl, was participating in school athletics with cisgender girls."

## Defamatory Terms to Avoid

### "deceptive," "fooling," "pretending," "posing," or "masquerading"
Gender identity is an integral part of a person's identity. Do not characterize transgender people as "deceptive," as "fooling" or "trapping" others, or as "pretending" to be, "posing" or "masquerading" as a man or a woman. Such descriptions are inaccurate, defamatory and insulting.

### "tranny," "she-male," "he/she," "it," "shim," or "trap"
These words dehumanize transgender people and should not be used in mainstream media. The criteria for using these derogatory terms should be the same as those applied to vulgar epithets used to target other groups: they should not be used unless the transgender person describes themself with the term or in a direct quote that reveals the bias of the person quoted. So that such words are not given credibility in the media, it is preferred that reporters say, "The person used a derogatory word for a transgender person" except when a trans person uses the term to describe themself. Please note that while some transgender people may use "tranny" to describe themselves, others find it extremely offensive even when used by another trans person.
