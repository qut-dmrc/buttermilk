The religion\'s failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been
criticized. The Watch Tower Society\'s policy is that elders inform authorities when
 required by law to do so, but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his
 or her family. The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child
Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse
identified by the Jehovah\'s Witnesses within their organization since 1950,
"not one was reported by the church to secular authorities." William Bowen, a former
Jehovah\'s Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex
abuse victims within the religion, has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers
from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities, and other critics claim
the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its "crime-free"
 reputation. In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower
 Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from
 known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child
abuse lawsuits out of court, reportedly paying as much as $780,000 to one plaintiff
without admitting wrongdoing.

Question: What have courts in both the UK and the US found the Watch Tower Society to
