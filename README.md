# buttermilk: opinionated data tools for HASS scholars

**AI and data tools for HASS researchers, putting culture first.**

Developed by and for @QUT-DMRC scholars, this repo aims to provide standard **flows** that help scholars make their own **pipelines** to collect data and use machine learning, generative AI, and computational techniques as part of rich analysis and experimentation that is driven by theory and deep understanding of cultural context. We try to:

* Provide a set of research-backed analysis tools that help scholars bring cultural expertise to computational methods.
* Help HASS scholars with easy, well-documented, and proven tools for data collection and analysis.
* Make ScholarOpsâ„¢ easier with opinionated defaults that take care of logging and archiving in standard formats.
* Create a space for collaboration, experimentation, and evaluation of computational methods for HASS scholars.
