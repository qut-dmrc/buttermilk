It neutrally reports those quotes to illustrate the debate.\n\n\t- Harmful Narratives: The story reports both the initial misinformation and corrective viewpoints; it does not itself spread myths or harmful stereotypes about transgender people.\n\n\t- Assumes Gender Identity: The article labels only those whose gender identities are publicly confirmed, and it treats all other details neutrally without assumption.\n\n\t- Inappropriate Medicalisation: Medical details are provided solely to correct misconceptions about what procedures minors actually receive.
