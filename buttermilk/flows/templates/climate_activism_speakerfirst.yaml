        description: Frame analysis of articles around climate activism.
        summary: Identification of frame elements after Entman (1993) at the level of statements.
        comments: This prompt draws from Entman's (1993) conceptualisation of framing to identify a speaker and their affiliation, a problem definition, cause of the problem, attribution of blame, a solution and a solution addressees from each statement in a news article, if they are present.
        task: You are a researcher that analyses news articles and identifies how a text is framed. Frames identify a speaker and their affiliation, a problem definition, cause of the problem, attribution of blame, a solution and a solution addressees from each statement in a news article, if they are present.
        instructions: |
            Your task is to read the following article and analyse the framing of the text. 
            First, identify each entity that 'speaks' in the article and their affiliation. This could be the author or a quoted source.
            Then, for each speaker, identify the following frame elements: all of the problems that the speaker discusses, as well as the related causes, blame attributions, solutions and solution addressees, as defined by the speaker. If you are unable to provide an answer, state 'None found'.

            Frame elements: 
            ```
            'speaker_name':
                Task: Identify the speaker by their name. This can be either the author or a quoted source, including individuals and organisations, and can be quoted directly or indirectly (e.g. Mary said...).
                Example 1: Author
                Example 2: Gemma Price-Quintner
                Example 3: Keith Pill

                Example 7: Author
                Example 8: Tahli

            'speaker_affiliation:
                Task: Concisely identify the speaker's role in the text.
                Example 1: Journalist
                Example 2: Year 12 student and NT rally organiser 
                Example 3: LNP MP

                Example 7: Journalist
                Example 8: Student

            'problem_definition':
                Task: If the speaker revers to climate activism, climate protest or climate protestors, identify ALL stated or implied problems presented by the the speaker. I am particularly interested in problems related to climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future and School Strike for Climate. Present the problem definitions in a list.
                Example 1: Street blockages by adult activists are a public nuisance that leave most people cold. 
                Example 2: Lack of representation from parliament regarding the protests
                Example 3: Inadequate climate change education in the national curriculum
                Example 4: Australia's national security laws may have been used to target journalists and whistleblowers, including protesters
                Example 5: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
                Example 6: Extinction Rebellion being listed as an extremist ideology
                Example 7: Left-wing lobby groups are exploiting and scaring kids out of their classrooms
                Example 8: Students largely working without adult guidance.

            'problem_definition_synthesis'
                Task: Summarise the problem definitions to produce a single, detailed problem definition. Make sure you include aspects of all the problem definitions in your synthesis, but state the facts only and be as concise as possible.
                Example: Climate change education is not adequately addressed in schools

            'statements':
                Task: For each problem definition, identify the statement in the text that supports the problem definition. I expect at least three and up to five per problem definition/speaker. Present these statements in a list. If you are unable to provide an answer, state 'None found'.
                Example 1: Street blockages by adult activists are a public nuisance that leave most people cold. 
                Example 2: We still haven't seen any representation from our parliament come down [to the protests],"" she said.
                Example 3: “I won’t be threatened by an email from an anonymous numpty from an organisation who are off on some ideological witch hunt with no real solutions,” Mr. Pitt told The Australian.
                Example 4: The report points to the government's cases against multiple whistleblowers and journalists, as well as bail conditions placed on climate change protesters, including former Greens senator Scott Ludlam
                Example 5: A report produced by advocacy group Human Rights Watch this week also found Australia's national security laws may have been used to target journalists and whistleblowers, including protesters
                Example 6: Last week, England's Counter Terror Police listed it as an extremist ideology, deeming it a threat to national security alongside the likes of neo-Nazi terrorism and Islamic extremism. 
                Example 7: Environmental groups including Greenpeace, 350.org, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the youth-run Australian Youth Climate Coalition have also lent a hand - donating supplies, running safety training and walking students through obtaining police permits. This time around, they've been more involved - as workers and university students also prepare to march - which has fuelled allegations left-wing lobby groups are the secret masterminds of the movement, exploiting and scaring kids out of their classrooms.
                Example 8: In the final planning meeting on Wednesday, 17-year-old Tahli said the last Canberra strike had been a "mad scramble", with students largely working without adult guidance."We were trying to sort stuff out right up til the night before," she said. "There were so many things we hadn't thought about."

            'cause_of_problem':
                Task: For each problem definition, tell me what the speaker indicates is the cause of the problem. Not every problem will have a cause. Sometimes, the cause is directly stated and sometimes the cause is an implied systemic or structural issue, such as climate change. Only provide a cause where there is enough evidence to do so. Present the causes in a list.
                Example 1: Adult activists blocking streets
                Example 2: Young people being ignored by the NT government/those in power, despite their efforts
                Example 3: None found
                Example 4: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
                Example 5: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
                Example 6: Extinction Rebellion's past actions
                Example 7: Increased involvement and support from Environmental groups
                Example 8: Lack  of guidance from adult figures regarding climate activism

                Task: Summarise the causes into an overarching cause.

            'blame_attribution':
                Task: For each problem, identify the person or thing that the speaker directly or indirectly blames for the problem. Not every problem will have a blame attribution; only include if the recipient of blame is clear. Present the blame attributions in a list. If you are unable to provide an answer, state 'None found'.
                Example 1: Extinction Rebellion Protestors
                Example 2: The Government
                Example 3: None found
                Example 4: The Australian government

            'solution_to_problem':
                Task: For each problem, identify the solution that the speaker promotes to address the problem. Provide quotes from the text that support your answer. Not every problem will have a solution; only include if the cause of the solution to the problem is clear. Present the solutions in a list. If you are unable to provide an answer, state 'None found'.
                Example 1: Extinction Rebellion protestors should protest in a less disruptive manner
                Example 2: The government to change position, and engage with youth
                Example 3: None found
                Example 4: None found
                Example 5: None found
                Example 6: None found
                Example 7: Environmental groups should stay out of the students' lives and stop scaring them out of their classrooms
                Example 8: Adult guidance and involvement

            'solution_to_problem_synthesis':
                Task: Summarise the solutions to the problem into an overarching cause.
