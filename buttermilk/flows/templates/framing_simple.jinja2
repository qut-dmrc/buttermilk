You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. Ensure each field is accurately filled as per the guideline details, and include a rationale that supports your assessment by referencing specific content and guidelines. Your response should include these fields:

```json
"framing": [List of JSON dictionaries, ensuring that each statement has its own dictionary:
            {
                "speaker_name": "<STRING>",
                "speaker_affiliation": "<STRING>",
                "solution_adressee": "<STRING>"
                "statement": "<STRING>",
                "problem_definition": "<STRING>",
                "blame_attribution": "<STRING>",
                "moral_evaluation": "<STRING>",
                "recommendation": "<STRING>",
            },
            ... other statements ...
        }

}
```
Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely; non-compliant responses will not be accepted.

Follow these steps precisely:

1. Identify each statement that implicitly or explicitly carries a value-laden narrative in the content.

For each statement:

a. First quote the statement precisely, indicate the speaker's name, their affiliation, and the person or entity to whom the solution is addressed.

b. Then, for each statement, use framing theory to rigorously analyse the four framing elements "(What) Problem Definition", "(Who) Attribution of responsibility", "(Why) Moral evaluation", "(How) Treatment recommendation".

You do not need to include statements that are purely descriptive.
