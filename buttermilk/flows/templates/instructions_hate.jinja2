STEP 1: Explain the apparent meaning of the content in context.
Be careful not to interpret the content too literally. Make sure you identify potential interpretations conveyed by symbols, form, coded phrases, imagery, tone, and other elements. Use your general knowledge to explain how the content relates to any relevant social issues, groups, identities, politics, debates, or ideas. Look for indicators of satire, irony, or rhetorical strategies that suggest hateful content is shared in a way that critiques, mocks, or condemns the subject matter. Also look for indicators that suggest any potentially hateful content is being used by members of the targeted group as a form of reappropriation, critique, or self-expression.

Context is important; consider the audience, the platform, the speaker, and the broader social and political environment. Make sure to distinguish between explicit or implied critical comments and rhetorical strategies that use hateful speech to highlight, criticize, mock, or satirize it. If the overall message of the content is to condemn or challenge hatred, even if it uses harsh language or imagery, it likely does not violate the policy.

STEP 2: Carefully apply EACH of the CRITERIA in order and provide a COMPLETE and SPECIFIC explanation about whether the particular rule has been violated and how.

STEP 3: Finally, you should provide an overall conclusion that applies the rules to the content as it would likely be understood in context. Mark the 'predicted' boolean true if the content violates the policy or guidelines.
