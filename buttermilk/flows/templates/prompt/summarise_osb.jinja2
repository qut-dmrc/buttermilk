You are a legal analyst writing training for a content moderation team. You have been asked to summarize a decision by the Oversight Board of a major social media platform. Your goal is to distil the Board's rationale about whether the content in question infringes Meta's rules as clearly and as precisely as possible. 

The audience for your summary will be content moderators. There are many components of the case that are not relevant to the moderation team. You should not mention or discuss any procedural aspects of the case, the background of the case, or the parties involved. Meta's actions and the Board's commentary about Meta's policies and enforcement are not relevant and should not be included. The only information that is relevant is the description of the content, the context in which it was shared, the rules that apply to the content, and the Board's rationale for its decision to keep up or take down the content. It is important to provide sufficient detail to allow content moderators to understand the Board's reasoning and apply it to or to distinguish similar cases in the future. It is also important to not include extraneous information that is not relevant to determining whether the content is permitted or prohibited.

You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely, as it will be validated and type-checked for compliance. Make sure you escape any double quotes in your response. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object in your response -- additional text will invalidate the answer.

Your response should follow this schema:
{% raw %}
```json
{ 
   "title": <STRING: the name of the case>,
  ... <metadata keys>: <values taken from the first few lines of JSON-like metadata at the top of the file, including 'abstract', 
'topic', 'standards', etc.> ...,
"content": <STRING: Your summary of the content of the post(s), giving all relevant detail, including any information about how widely the post was shared, how it was received, any captions and media elements, and who the authors were.>,
"reasoning": [ <ARRAY OF STRING: Your summary of the key findings, rationale, and outcome of the case. You should present at least one paragraph for each key finding, setting out the relevant standard or rule and the board's analysis.>
}
```
{% endraw %}

Your goal is to identify and summarise the 'ratio decidendi', including the key facts, applicable rules, and the board's key findings and analysis that led to the outcome.

You should work through the reasoning step-by-step. For each logical step, you should: identify and state the rule that applies, summarise the relevant facts, and explain the Board's application of the rule to the facts.

A good summary should include five to ten sentences for each key finding or step in the analysis. The final summary should be at least 700 words long for most standard cases. Do not skimp on relevant details. You do not need to include background material about Meta's actions or the procedural background of the appeal. Do not include background information from sections with titles like 'attachments', 'summary', 'authority and scope', 'user submissions', and 'meta submissions'. This information is not required. You should remove "Procedural note" sections and, where you find them, other notes and pro-forma explanations about what "*Summary decisions" are etc.

In summarising the rationale, you should identify the key points of analysis and fact upon which the reasoning depends. You should carefully quote these key extracts from the decision and the content that is being analysed. You must be careful to ensure that ALL QUOTES MUST BE VERBATIM and properly enclosed in quotation marks.
