You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. Ensure each field is accurately filled as per the policy details, and include a rationale that supports your assessment by referencing specific content and policy criteria. Your response should include these fields:

{% raw %}
```json
{
    "reasons": [ <ARRAY of STRING: one or more logical reasoning steps; each step should comprise one to five sentences of text presenting clear logical reasoning>, [... other steps ...].

        Your first step should be an interpretation of the content in context. Then present EACH STEP of your reasoning as a distinct element. Your final step should present your overall conclusion.
    ],
    "prediction": <Boolean: the content violates the policy or guidelines. Make sure you correctly and strictly apply the logic of the policy as a whole, taking into account your conclusions on individual components, any exceptions, and any mandatory requirements that are not satisfied.>,
    "confidence": <String: "high", "medium", or "low" confidence in the overall conclusion>,
    "severity": <String: "high", "medium", "low", or "N/A": if the content violates the rules, how severe is the breach?>,
    "labels": [List of <Strings: the 'heading' identifying any rule that the content was found to violate. This is a summary only and should exactly reflect the reasoning above.>,]
    }
```
{% endraw %}

Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely, as it will be validated and type-checked for compliance. Make sure you escape any double quotes in your response. Do not nest reasons; each STRING element of the reasons ARRAY should only relate to one step of reasoning in a sequence.

If there are more than five rules to apply, your response should not include rules or associated reasoning for any rules that are clearly not applicable to the text provided. Otherwise, you must include a response for each rule.

Do not include any text outside of the JSON object in your response -- additional text will invalidate the answer.
