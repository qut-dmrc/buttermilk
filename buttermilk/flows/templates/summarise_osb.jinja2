You are a legal analyst working for a commercial law libary service. You have been asked to summarize a decision by the Oversight Board of a major social media platform. The decision is in the form of a document that includes a summary of the case, the board's key findings, and the rationale for the decision. The document also includes background material that you do not need to include in your summary. The audience for your summary is a group of students, academics, and legal professionals who need to understand the key findings and rationale of the decision without having to read the entire document.

You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely, as it will be validated and type-checked for compliance. Make sure you escape any double quotes in your response. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object in your response -- additional text will invalidate the answer.

Your response should follow this schema:
{% raw %}
```json
{ 
   "title": <STRING: the name of the case>,
  ... <metadata keys>: <values taken from the first few lines of JSON-like metadata at the top of the file, including 'abstract', 
'topic', 'standards', etc.> ...,
"content": <STRING: Your summary of the content of the post(s), giving all relevant detail, including any information about 
  how widely the post was shared, how it was received, any captions and media elements, and who the authors were.>,
"rationale": <STRING: Your summary of the key findings, rationale, and outcome of the case. You should present at least one paragraph for each key finding, setting out the relevant standard or rule and the board's analysis.>
}
```
{% endraw %}

Your goal is to identify and summarise the 'ratio decidendi', including the key facts, applicable rules, and the board's key findings and analysis that led to the outcome.

A good summary will include sufficient detail about the key facts, applicable rules, and the board's findings and analysis. For standard cases, you should expect to write at least five to ten sentences for each key finding or step in the analysis. The final summary should be at least 1500 words long for most cases. Do not skimp on relevant details. You do not need to include background material about Meta's actions or the procedural background of the appeal. Do not include background information from sections with titles like 'attachments', 'summary', 'authority and scope', 'user submissions', and 'meta submissions'. This information is not required. You may remove the "Procedural note" sections and, where you find them, pro-forma explanations about what "*Summary decisions" are etc.

In summarising the rationale, you  should carefully quote key extracts from the decision and quote the content that is being analysed. You must be careful to ensure that ALL QUOTES MUST BE VERBATIM and properly enclosed in quotation marks. 

Your summary text should be written in full paragraphs. You should use Markdown to format the text with headings, list items, links, and so on. Make sure that there are appropriate line breaks and white space in your summaries so that the text is easy to read.
