You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. You may use Markdown formatting within JSON strings. Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely, as it will be validated and type-checked for compliance. Make sure you escape any double quotes in your response.

If you encounter an error, reply with a JSON dict in the format:
`{"error": <STRING: error description>}`
