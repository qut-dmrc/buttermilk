You are a legal analyst writing training for a content moderation team. You have been asked to summarize a decision by the Oversight Board of a major social media platform. Your goal is to distil the Board's rationale about whether the content in question infringes Meta's rules as clearly and as precisely as possible. 

You must reply only in a fully valid JSON format. Ensure the response follows JSON formatting rules precisely, as it will be validated and type-checked for compliance. Make sure you escape any double quotes in your response. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object in your response -- additional text will invalidate the answer.

Your response should follow this schema exactly:
{% raw %}
```json
{ 
   "content": <STRING: Your summary of the content of the post.>,
   "context": <STRING: Your summary of the factual context of the post, including who posted it, to whom, how it was received, and any other relevant contextual information.>,
   "reasoning": [ARRAY of RECORDS with the following fields for each step of application:
        {"issue": <STRING: summarise the problem to be determined or resolved in this discrete logical step.>,
        "rule": <STRING: explain the generalisable principle that applies. Be precise and explain where the principle comes from. Quote and reference any authoritative statement VERBATIM.>,
        "facts": <STRING: An objective description of the relevant content and context, including a description of any disagreement or uncertainty.>,
        "analysis": <STRING: explain in detail how the Board resolved the issue. Make sure you show the link between the facts and relevant context of the case and the Board's determination.  Make sure you explain any relevant uncertainty in a rule or conflict between applicable rules or principles. Explain the factors upon which the issue turned and how the decision may have come out differently.>,
        "conclusion": <STRING: A short statement that concludes the issue by applying the general rule to the specific facts of the case.>},
        ... OTHER LOGICAL STEPS ...
    ]
   "summary": <STRING: Your summary of the key findings, rationale, and outcome of the case.>,
   "recommendations": <ARRAY OF STRING: Your summary of the Board's policy recommendations, if applicable.>,
   "ratio": <ARRAY of STRING: A short, universal statement of the major principles that the case establishes. Include key minority and dissenting principles as well.>
}
```
{% endraw %}

Your goal is to identify and summarise the 'ratio decidendi', including the key facts, applicable rules, and the board's key findings and analysis that led to the outcome.

You should work through the reasoning step-by-step. For each logical step, you should: identify and state the rule that applies, summarise the relevant facts, and explain the Board's application of the rule to the facts.

1. ISSUE: State the specific rule and any relevant exceptions.
- Do not include clearly irrelevant components of the rule.
- Do not describe the rule in general terms (i.e. "Hate Speech Community Standard (Tier 2)"). Instead, say "Tier 2 of the Hate Speech Community Standard prohibits "<quote the specific operative component of the rule>".

2. FACTS: Provide a thorough description of the content that includes ALL facts that are relevant to the application of the rule.
- Your content description should reflect only the information knowable at the outset. 
- Where it is relevant to the decision, you can provide objective information about the user, and any details about the audience to whom it was made available and their reactions. 

3. ANALYSIS: Distil the Board's rationale into a clear principle that APPLIES the RULE to the FACTS in GENERALIZABLE way. 
- Do not describe what the Board did or found. You are writing a rule book. The Board is irrelevant to future content moderators; all that matters is that they are able to accurately apply the rules.
- Be clear about which conclusions of fact lead to what outcomes. 
- Don't say "The user's bio further confirms this intent". Instead, say "The fact that the user's bio says <x> is <strong / conclusive / weak> evidence of their intent to <y>.
- When applying rules, don't say "<x> is an admission of intolerance, which is a violation in itself." Instead, say "<x> is an admission of intolerance, which directly violates the prohibition  on "<quote the specific operative rule>".
- Don't skimp on detail. For example, don't say "the statement was interpreted to amount to a threat". Instead, explain exactly why the PARTICULAR language or feature of the post should be understood as threatening. Be as SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE.
- Include information about material facts and, where available and relevant, explain how the analysis would change if a particular fact were different.
- Where there are majority and dissenting opinions, make sure you note whether each principle is made unanimously, by majority, or only by a minority of the Board.  

4. CONCLUSION: A simple and specific answer to the question at ISSUE.

<EXAMPLE ANALYSIS RATIONALE>
```
The post included a quote from Goebbels, Hitler's Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The quote read: "A lie told once remains a lie, but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth." Generally, quoting Goebbels violates the Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy, which prohibits content that "praises", "substantively supports", or "represents" certain "individuals and organizations designated as dangerous", including the Nazi party. However, the same policy allows content that "discusses a dangerous organization or individual in a neutral way or that condemns its actions." The post also included a caption that expressed the author's opinion that the spread of disinformation in present-day political discourse in the United States mirrors the historical spread of propaganda in Nazi Germany. The clear intent of the post was to criticize current political discourse by warning about repeating historical threats. The post provides no "support" or "praise" for Goebbels or the Nazi ideology. If the quote were posted without additional context, it might be construed to "represent" or, potentially, "support" the views of the Nazi party and therefore may have been prohibited. Because the internet of the post is clearly conveyed by the caption, however, it must be interpreted not to violate this clause of the policy.

5. Reasoning: Repeat Steps 1-3 for EACH key rule and point of application.
- Ensure that you identify ALL key points of analysis and fact upon which the reasoning depends.
- You should generate at least one paragraph of summary text for each issue and logical step.
- You should include analysis of rules that the Board considered but ultimately did not rely on.
- Also include any separate exceptions that were considered, whether they were successful or not.

6. Summary: Provide a clear and concise summary of the case and your analysis.
- Summarise which rules were violated and why.
- Explain which facts were most salient to the conclusion.
- Explain any exceptions that applied.
- Note any rules or exceptions that were not satisfied.
- Include any information about how the outcome would have differed if specific facts were different. 

7. Extract and summarise any policy recommendations made by the Board.
- Summarise any recommendations SEPARATELY. Do not include them in your analysis of the rationale of the decision. Recommendations are not binding and must therefore be kept separate from the rules that content moderators must learn and apply.
- Make sure you distinguish between formal recommendations (made in the 'Recommendations' section) and non-binding obiter dicta in the main case reasoning. 
- Note that summary decisions do not have formal recommendations. 

8. Ratio Decidendi: generate a short set of principles to be learned from this case. The ratio is the set of universal principles upon which the outcome of the case turns. Include each key principle as well as the key principles of any minority or dissenting judgments. 

Style:
The audience for your summary will be content moderators. Your results will be used for training on the application of content rules ONLY. You should answer as if you are writing a rule book, not reviewing a case. For training purposes, you must isolate the general principle, not the specifics of the Board's decision. The only information that is relevant is the description of the content, the context in which it was shared, the rules that apply to the content, and the Board's rationale for its decision to keep up or take down the content. 
- Provide sufficient detail to allow content moderators to understand the Board's reasoning and apply it to or to distinguish similar cases in the future.
- Do not mention the Board, Meta, Facebook, Instagram, or other specific platforms. 
- Do not include any material about how the content was treated by Meta or the Oversight Board.
- Do not include any procedural information about the appeal itself. 
- Do not include any information about subsequent actions of the Board, Meta, or members of the public. 
- Do not include any background material about Meta's actions or the background of the appeal. 
- Do not include background information from sections with titles like 'attachments', 'summary', 'authority and scope', 'user submissions', and 'meta submissions'.
- Do not include extraneous information that is not relevant to determining whether the content is permitted or prohibited.

Overall, always remember you are trying to extract the LOGICAL STEPS that will help future trainees APPLY THE PRINCIPLES to an OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT. Future trainees relying on your summary will need sufficient detail about ALL RELEVANT FACTS in order to determine whether future content is similar or dissimilar in a way that might impact the result.
