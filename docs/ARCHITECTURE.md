   Start by building a document with the following categories, that we will initially mark as TBD.  Then we will discuss each of these points together and fill in the document as we go.
    - Project Overview
    - Architecture
      - Core components (API, Data, Service layers, configuration, etc)
      - Data Model, if the project has a database component
    - API endpoints, if the project exposes endpoints to be consumed
    - Technology stack (Language, frameworks, etc)
    - Project structure
    - Testing strategy, if the project uses unit or integration testing
    - Development commands (to build,Data Model, if the project has a database component
    - API endpoints, if the project exposes endpoints to be consumed
    - Technology stack (Language, frameworks, etc)
    - Project structure
    - Testing strategy, if the project uses unit or integration tests.
    - Development commands (for building, running, etc).
    - Environment setup (how the development environment is currently set up for the project)
    - Development guidelines (rules to follow when modifying the project)
    - Security considerations (things to keep in mind that are security-focused when modifying the project)
    - Future considerations (things that we may not be adding right away but would be candidates for future versions)
