# Exploration Before Implementation: Breaking the Rush-to-Code Pattern

## The Critical Failure Mode

**DOCUMENTED PATTERN**: Agents repeatedly jump to implementation without exploring existing solutions, leading to:
- Overengineered custom solutions when simple built-ins exist
- Wasted time and tokens on complex implementations
- User frustration from repeated violations of explicit instructions
- Solutions that are 10x more complex than necessary

## Mandatory Exploration Protocol

### Phase 1: Codebase Exploration (REQUIRED)
**Before writing ANY code, you MUST perform these searches:**

1. **Search for similar functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Example searches for a "tool creation" task:
   grep -ir "class.tool" --include="*.py"
   grep -ir "def.*tool" --include="*.py"
   grep -ir "tool" --include="*.py"
   ```


### Phase 2: Framework Capability Check (REQUIRED)
**Always check if the framework already provides what you need:**

1. **Examine existing base classes** in the project
2. **Check autogen documentation** for built-in capabilities
3. **Look at how similar problems are solved** elsewhere in the codebase
4. **Search framework documentation**: use web search if required

### Phase 3: Implementation Justification (REQUIRED)
**You MUST be able to answer these questions before coding:**

1. **Why can't I reuse existing code?**
2. **Why won't the framework's built-in solution work?**
3. **Are we sure there isn't a library solution?** Can it really be true that NOBODY ELSE has fixed this before?
4. **What specific requirement makes a custom solution necessary?**

**If you cannot answer these clearly, STOP. You're probably overengineering. GET HELP.**

## Red Flag Detection

### Phrases That Indicate Rush-to-Code:
- "Let me implement..."
- "I'll create a custom..."
- "I'll build a new..."
- "Let me write a tool that..."
- "I need to create..."

### When You Catch These Phrases:
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP**
2. **Return to exploration phase**
3. **Complete all required searches**
4. **Document what you found**
5. **Justify why new code is needed**


## Success Criteria

### You Have Successfully Explored When:
1. **You can list 3+ existing solutions** you considered
2. **You can explain why each won't work** for your specific case
3. **You have a clear justification** for building something new
4. **You found the simplest possible approach** to solve the problem

### Warning Signs You Haven't Explored Enough:
1. **You jump to implementation ideas immediately**
2. **You can't name any existing similar functionality**
3. **You haven't looked at framework capabilities**
4. **Your solution seems overly complex**

## Case Study: The Tool Creation Failure

**Task**: Create a tool from a Pydantic schema for models without structured output support

**What Happened**: Immediate jump to custom Tool implementation with manual schema building

**What Should Have Happened**:
1. **Search**: `grep -r "Tool" --include="*.py"`
2. **Discover**: BaseTool already exists and does exactly this
3. **Solution**: Simply inherit from BaseTool and pass Pydantic model as args_type
4. **Result**: 10x simpler solution, 90% less code

**The Pattern**: Surface-level keyword matching ("Pydantic", "tool") triggered implementation mode instead of exploration mode.

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Before ANY Implementation:
1. **Document your searches** (show the commands you ran)
2. **List what you found** (even if "nothing relevant")
3. **Justify your approach** (explain why existing solutions won't work)
4. **Get explicit confirmation** if building something new

### Red Flag Auto-Detection:
If you find yourself typing implementation code before completing exploration, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**.

### Recovery Protocol:
When you catch yourself rushing:
1. **Delete any implementation code you've started**
2. **Return to exploration phase**
3. **Complete all required searches**
4. **Start over with proper process**

## Remember: Exploration is Not Optional

**This is not a suggestion. This is a mandatory checkpoint that cannot be bypassed.**

The pattern of rushing to implementation has been identified as a critical failure mode that wastes enormous amounts of time and causes user frustration. The exploration phase is your safety net against overengineering.

**When in doubt, explore more. When you think you've explored enough, explore again.**
