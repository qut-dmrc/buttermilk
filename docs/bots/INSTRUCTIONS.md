Buttermilk aims to make it easy for HASS scholars to use AI tools in a way that is understandable, traceable, and reproducible.

# CRITICAL RULES for 🤖 LLM Agents: 

* ALWAYS follow the workflow. No exceptions.
* ASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. 
* DO NOT try to fix errors you do not fully understand.
* STOP if you get stuck. No workarounds.
* EVERYTHING is VALIDATED on rigorous academic research. DO NOT MAKE substantive decisions on your own. NO ASSUMPTIONS. No single-use scripts, no dummy examples; use ONLY our validated examples.
* Prioritise reproducibility & traceability.
* Flexible, modular design aimed at future Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences researchers.

Specific rules:
- VERIFY SUCCESS, never assume: ALWAYS check the results of commands (exit codes AND result text).
- When given a specific task with a specific method, you MUST use that exact method. Any deviation is a failure. Success is ONLY achieving the exact outcome requested using the exact method specified. NO SUBSTITUTIONS.
- If asked to use Tool X, use Tool X. Don't use Tool Y instead. Don't read code instead. Don't check logs instead. Use Tool X.
- Success = user's definition, not yours. If asked to SHOW something, you must visually demonstrate it, not just prove it exists.
- When you can't complete a task as specified, STOP immediately and say so. Don't waste time on workarounds.
- **DEBUGGING RULE**: For ANY debugging task, you MUST first check `docs/bots/debugging.md` and use the documented tools (WebSocket CLI, log analyzers, etc.) BEFORE reading source code. Going straight to source code is a workflow violation.
- **OUTPUT RULE**: Keep outputs concise. When using debugging tools, focus on relevant excerpts. Avoid dumping entire JSON responses or log files. If output exceeds 50 lines, summarize key findings instead.
- **NO IMPLICIT DEFAULTS**: NEVER use implicit defaults or fallback behaviors. All configuration must be explicit. If something is missing, FAIL FAST with clear error messages. Do not infer, assume, or provide defaults.
- **DATA CONTRACTS**: Schema changes require updating ALL components atomically. See `docs/bots/data-architecture.md` for data contract principles. No defensive programming - trust schemas and let errors propagate.
- **NO SINGLE-USE SCRIPTS**: NEVER create standalone test scripts or dummy examples. Always write proper tests in the existing test suite using pytest conventions. Test files must be reusable, follow project structure, and integrate with the CI/CD pipeline. 

## CRITICAL FIRST STEPS
1. **For Debugging Tasks**: ALWAYS read `docs/bots/debugging.md` FIRST
2. **For Development Tasks**: Follow the 9-step workflow below
3. **For Research Tasks**: Use documented tools, not source code exploration

## WORKFLOW: Before Making Any Code Changes
1. **STOP**: Understand the full problem scope before proposing solutions. Read relevant documentation to understand the project goals and architecture. Check github issues for relevant past work and discussion; create a new issue if you cannot find an existing one.
2. **ANALYZE**: Map the system architecture and identify root causes
3. **PLAN**: Use github issues to track problems and document your plan with clear phases and validation criteria
4. **TEST**: Write unit tests that capture expected behavior. Save your tests; do not use single-use tests or scripts.
5. **IMPLEMENT**: Make minimal changes that solve the root cause
6. **DOCUMENT**: ALWAYS document your code with clear docstrings and comments
7. **VALIDATE**: Use the project's end-to-end debugging tools to ensure no regressions and all success criteria are met
8. **COMMIT** and **UPDATE GITHUB ISSUES**: Commit your changes in logical chunks and document each step in the appropriate github issue. If you're working independently, don't forget to file a pull request with your new changes!
9. **REFLECT**: Review your performance and update the `docs/bots` instructions if necessary to avoid mistakes.


## Key technical hints
- Repository: @qut-dmrc/buttermilk
- Owner: @nicsuzor
- Architecture: YAML configuration (/conf); FastAPI backend (buttermilk/api); Autogen-based LLM groupchat flows; web (/buttermilk/frontend/chat) and cli (/buttermilk/frontend/cli) frontends.
- Run python with `uv run ...`
- **Composable YAML Configuration**: Use Hydra (OmegaConf objects) exclusively for configuration
- Use heredocs when writing in shell to avoid escaping issues

## REFLECTIVE and EXPERIMENTAL workflow

We are CONTINUOSLY refining our workflow. Agents ONLY remember the information we provide. Maintain the `docs/bots/` folder with essential information for robot developers.
- Use [INDEX.md](docs/bots/INDEX.md) to index and link to documentation and external tools.
- Update documents every time there is a key change (but not minor issues)
- Include all GENERAL important information developers need to understand, but REMOVE minor details or information that is specific to a particular task or scenario.
- Be CONCISE to save tokens.
- If you find conflicting information, ask the user for clarification, and then update the documents.
