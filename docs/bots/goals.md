# Buttermilk Project Goals & Philosophy

## Core Mission
Buttermilk provides AI and data tools for HASS (Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) researchers, putting culture first. We make computational methods accessible while maintaining research rigor and reproducibility.

## Primary Goals

### 1. HASS-Centric Design
- **Prioritize usability** for researchers without deep technical expertise
- **Preserve cultural context** in all computational methods
- **Support qualitative research** methodologies alongside quantitative analysis
- **Enable theory-driven** exploration rather than purely data-driven approaches

### 2. Reproducibility & Traceability
- **Track every experiment** with versioned configurations and data
- **Maintain audit trails** for all processing and analysis steps
- **Enable result verification** through clear provenance
- **Support collaborative research** with shareable, reproducible workflows

### 3. Modularity & Extensibility
- **Composable components** that researchers can mix and match
- **Plugin architecture** for adding new agents and tools
- **No modification of core** - extend through subclassing
- **Configuration-driven** workflows using Hydra/YAML

### 4. ScholarOpsâ„¢
- **Opinionated defaults** that handle logging, archiving, and versioning
- **Standard formats** for data storage and exchange
- **Cloud-ready** with support for GCP, Azure, and local development
- **Best practices** baked in for MLOps in humanities research

## Design Principles

### Architecture Principles
1. **Flows over Scripts**: Research pipelines as first-class citizens
2. **Agents as Specialists**: Each agent has one clear purpose
3. **Configuration as Code**: All settings in version-controlled YAML
4. **Async by Default**: Responsive, concurrent operations

### Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests before implementation
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Understand before changing
3. **Documentation-First**: Docs stay synchronized with code
4. **Fail Fast**: Validate early, surface errors clearly

### User Experience Principles
1. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple tasks stay simple
2. **Meaningful Errors**: Clear guidance when things go wrong
3. **Sensible Defaults**: Works out-of-box for common cases
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect research contexts and ethics

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **HASS Researchers**: Scholars needing computational methods
- **Digital Humanities**: Researchers combining traditional and digital approaches
- **Social Scientists**: Those analyzing cultural and social phenomena
- **Graduate Students**: Learning computational research methods

### Secondary Users
- **Research Engineers**: Building tools for HASS researchers
- **Data Scientists**: Collaborating with humanities scholars
- **Librarians/Archivists**: Managing research data and workflows

## Success Criteria

### For Researchers
- Can run complex AI workflows without programming
- Results are reproducible and citable
- Tools respect disciplinary norms and ethics
- Workflows integrate with existing research practices

### For Developers
- Clear patterns for extending functionality
- Well-documented APIs and interfaces
- Robust testing and debugging tools
- Active community and support

### For the Field
- Advances computational humanities methods
- Bridges technical and humanities communities
- Establishes best practices for AI in HASS
- Contributes to open research infrastructure

## Non-Goals

### What Buttermilk is NOT
- Not a general-purpose ML framework
- Not optimized for maximum performance over usability
- Not a replacement for domain expertise
- Not a black-box solution

### Trade-offs We Accept
- **Usability over Performance**: Prefer clarity to optimization
- **Opinions over Flexibility**: Opinionated defaults that work
- **Safety over Features**: Conservative with experimental features
- **Documentation over Assumption**: Explicit is better than implicit

## Ethical Commitments

### Research Ethics
- Respect for human subjects and cultural materials
- Transparency in computational methods
- Acknowledgment of limitations and biases
- Support for ethical review processes

### Open Science
- Open source development model
- Commitment to FAIR data principles
- Support for open access publishing
- Community-driven governance

Remember: Buttermilk exists to empower HASS researchers, not replace them. Every design decision should support scholarly inquiry while respecting disciplinary expertise and cultural contexts.
