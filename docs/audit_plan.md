  1. Core Architecture & Modularity Assessment

  - Examine Agent, Orchestrator, and Contract base classes for consistency
  - Identify cases where new classes were created instead of extending
  base classes
  - Look for violations of the "fewer classes" principle
  - Check for proper separation of concerns
  - Look for best practice improvements, including opportunities to use Pydantic classes with validators, good decisions using newer libraries and features like Protocols vs direct inheritance, benefits from using FastAPI, Litestar, httpx, Pandera, Loguru, anyio, etc.

  2. Data Flow & Traceability Analysis

  - Review AgentTrace and AgentOutput usage patterns
  - Assess BigQuery/GCS storage and retrieval mechanisms
  - Identify gaps in logging and versioning systems
  - Evaluate data conversion points that may lose information

  3. HASS Researcher Experience

  - Analyze frontend components for clarity and usability
  - Review API endpoints for intuitive naming and documentation
  - Assess configuration complexity and learning curve
  - Identify barriers to extension and customization

  4. Async/Concurrent Operations Review

  - Examine async/await usage in I/O operations
  - Check LLM call patterns for proper concurrency
  - Identify blocking operations that should be async
  - Review error handling in concurrent contexts

  5. Technical Debt Identification

  - Find obsolete code patterns mentioned in CLAUDE.md
  - Identify code that doesn't align with project principles
  - Look for duplicated functionality across modules
  - Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable

  6. Testing & Quality Assurance

  - Assess test coverage for critical paths
  - Review integration test patterns
  - Identify missing tests for new functionality
  - Check for disposable test scripts vs proper pytest tests

  7. DevOps/MLOps Practices

  - Review configuration management (Hydra usage)
  - Assess deployment and environment management
  - Check for proper error tracking and monitoring
  - Evaluate experiment tracking and reproducibility

  8. High-Impact Refactoring Targets

  Priority areas based on CLAUDE.md principles:
  - SQL view generation and management
  - Frontend-backend data contract standardization
  - Agent initialization interface consistency
  - Removal of backwards compatibility code

  This plan focuses on finding improvements that will have the greatest
  positive impact on extensibility, maintainability, and usability for
  HASS researchers while ensuring robust MLOps practices.
