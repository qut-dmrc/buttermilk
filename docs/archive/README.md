# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been superseded by the reorganized documentation structure.

## Archived Files

### Implementation Planning Documents
- `AGENT_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Planning doc for agent consolidation (implementation detail)
- `AGENT_ANNOUNCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details for agent announcements
- `implementation_blueprint.md` - General implementation planning document

### Superseded User Guides  
- `FLOWS.md` - Technical reference superseded by user-guide/flows.md and bots/ knowledge bank
- `getting_started_groupchat.md` - Superseded by getting-started/ directory structure
- `OSB_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md` - Flow-specific analysis superseded by clean user guide
- `OSB_FLOW_QUICKSTART.md` - Flow-specific quickstart superseded by user-guide/flows.md

## Why These Were Archived

These files were moved to the archive because they either:

1. **Contained implementation details** not relevant for end users
2. **Duplicated information** now better organized in the structured documentation
3. **Were planning documents** that served their purpose during development
4. **Conflicted with** the clean user journey established in the reorganized docs

## Reorganization Benefits

The new structure provides:
- **Clear audience separation** (HASS researchers vs LLM developers vs human developers)
- **Logical progression** from getting started to advanced usage
- **Single source of truth** for each type of information
- **Better discoverability** through proper categorization

## Recovery

If any of these archived documents contain information that should be preserved, it can be:
- **Integrated** into the appropriate section of the new structure
- **Referenced** from the relevant user-facing documentation
- **Updated** to match current patterns and moved back

The archive preserves the content while allowing the main documentation to stay clean and focused.
