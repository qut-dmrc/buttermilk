        task: 


Your task is to read the following article and analyse the framing of the text.
First, identify each statement and identify all climate-related problem definitions in the article.
Then, for each problem definition, identify the following frame elements: the speaker and their affilation, as well as the cause, blame attribution, solution and solution addressee, as defined by the speaker. If you are unable to provide an answer, state 'None found'.


Frame elements:
```

'statement':
    Task: Identify the statements in the text that contain a clear problem statement. A problem statement is a concise and clear description of an issue or challenge that needs to be addressed. A statement constitutes an idea or argument, conveyed through one or more sentences, so include entire paragraphs if appropriate. Make sure to analyse every statement, but ignore statements that are unrelated to climate. Also ignore statements for which there is no clearly-defined problem statement, such as 'The march, which began at the city's Town Hall, was organised by Extinction Rebellion and student groups'. I expect you to identify over ten statements.
    Example 1: Mr Morrison has not yet struck a deal with the Nationals over the climate and energy policy Australia will bring to Glasgow, including whether Australia will commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 — a target the majority of Australians support
    Example 2: We still haven't seen any representation from our parliament come down [to the protests],"" she said. t's still really focused by us and we are feeling ignored, but I am also hopeful for the future
    Example 3: Why was climate change hysteria one of the main reasons the teal fake independents and the Greens did so well in the recent election and the Morrison Coalition government so soundly defeated?
    Example 4: The report points to the government's cases against multiple whistleblowers and journalists, as well as bail conditions placed on climate change protesters, including former Greens senator Scott Ludlam
    Example 5: A report produced by advocacy group Human Rights Watch this week also found Australia's national security laws may have been used to target journalists and whistleblowers, including protesters
    Example 6: Last week, England's Counter Terror Police listed it as an extremist ideology, deeming it a threat to national security alongside the likes of neo-Nazi terrorism and Islamic extremism.
    Example 7: “I won’t be threatened by an email from an anonymous numpty from an organisation who are off on some ideological witch hunt with no real solutions,” Mr. Pitt told The Australian.
    Example 8: Notwithstanding their praise, the woke national curriculum is criticised for not going far enough.

'problem_definition':
    Task: If a statement in the article concerns climate change, climate activism, or climate protest and protestors, identify any stated or implied problems within the statement. I am particularly interested in problems related to climate activist groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future and School Strike for Climate.
    Example 1: Lack of commitment to climate targets despite public support
    Example 2: Lack of representation from parliament regarding the protests
    Example 3: Fake teal independents and Greens doing so well in the recent election
    Example 4: Australia's national security laws may have been used to target journalists and whistleblowers, including protesters
    Example 5: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
    Example 6: Extinction Rebellion being listed as an extremist ideology
    Example 7: Extinction Rebellion's tactics
    Example 8: Inadequate climate change education in the national curriculum

'speaker_name':

    Example 1: Author
    Example 2: Gemma Price-Quintner
    Example 3: Author
    Example 4: Human Rights Watch
    Example 5: Human Rights Watch
    Example 6: Author
    Example 7: Keith Pill
    Example 8: Five academics

'speaker_affiliation:

    Example 3: Journalist
    Example 4: Advocacy group
    Example 5: Advocacy group
    Example 6: Journalist
    Example 7: LNP MP
    Example 8: Academics specialising in school pedagogy, geography, journalism and marine studies

'cause_of_problem':
    Task: Tell me what the speaker indicates is the cause of the problem. Not every problem will have a cause. Sometimes, the cause is directly stated and sometimes the cause is an implied systemic or structural issue, such as climate change. Only provide a cause where there is enough evidence to do so.
    Example 1: Failure to strike a deal, despite the will of the constituents
    Example 2: Young people being ignored by the NT government/those in power, despite their efforts
    Example 3: Climate change hysteria
    Example 4: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
    Example 5: Australia's national security laws being used to target journalists and whistleblowers
    Example 6: Extinction Rebellion's past actions
    Example 7: None found
    Example 8: The national curriculum not providing adequate education on climate change

'blame_attribution':
    Task: Identify the person or thing that the speaker directly or indirectly blames for the problem. Not every problem will have a blame attribution; only include if the recipient of blame is clear.
    Example 1: Scott Morrison
    Example 2: The Government
    Example 3: What is taught in Australian schools
    Example 4: The Australian government
    Example 5: The Australian government
    Example 6: Extinction Rebellion
    Example 7: None found
    Example 8: The national curriculum

'solution_to_problem':
    Task: Identify the solution that the speaker promotes to address the problem. Provide quotes from the text that support your answer. Not every problem will have a solution; only include if the cause of the solution to the problem is clear.
    Example 1: Commit to a climate target
    Example 2: The government to change position, and engage with youth
    Example 3: None found
    Example 4: None found
    Example 5: None found
    Example 6: None found
    Example 7: None found
    Example 8: Infuse climate science into all areas of education

'solution_addressee':
    Task: Identify the direct or indirect target audience or intended recipient of the solution. Not every problem will have a solution addressee; only include if the solution addressee is clear.
    Example 1: Scott Morrison
    Example 2: The Government
    Example 3: None found
    Example 4: None found
    Example 5: None found
