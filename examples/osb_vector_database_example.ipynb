The post\\\\\\'s caption calls for soldiers of\\nthe Azov Regiment in Russian captivity to be returned. After the Board\\nbrought the appeal to Meta\\'s attention, the company reversed its\\noriginal decision and restored the post.\\n\\n## Case Description and Background\\n\\nIn December 2022, an Instagram user created a post with an image of the\\nAzov Regiment symbol. Overlaying the symbol was text in Ukrainian\\nasking, \"where is Azov?\" The caption stated that more than 700 Azov\\nsoldiers remain in Russian captivity, with their conditions unknown. The\\nuser calls for their return, stating: \"we must scream until all the\\nAzovs are back from captivity!\"\\n\\nThe user appealed the removal of the post, emphasizing the importance of\\nsharing information during times of war. The user also highlighted that\\nthe content did not violate Meta\\'s policies, since Meta allows content\\ncommenting on the Azov Regiment. The post received nearly 800 views and\\nwas detected by Meta\\'s automated systems.\\n\\nMeta originally removed the post from Facebook under its [Dangerous\\nOrganizations and Individuals (DOI)\\npolicy](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/), which prohibits\\ncontent that \"praises,\" \"substantively supports\" or \"represents\"\\nindividuals and organizations that Meta designates as dangerous.\\nHowever, Meta allows \"discussions about the human rights of designated\\nindividuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the\\ncontent includes other praise, substantive support or representation of\\ndesignated entities or other policy violations, such as incitement to\\nviolence.\"\\n\\nMeta told the Board that it removed the Azov Regiment from its Dangerous\\nOrganizations and Individuals list in January 2023. A [*Washington Post*\\narticle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/21/meta-azov-regiment-facebook-oversight/) states that Meta now\\ndraws a distinction between the Azov Regiment, which it views as under\\nformal control of the Ukrainian government, and other elements of the\\nbroader Azov movement, some which the company considers far-right\\nnationalists and still designates as dangerous.\\n\\nAfter the Board brought this case to Meta\\'s attention, the company\\ndetermined that its removal was incorrect and restored the content to\\nInstagram. The company acknowledged that the Azov Regiment is no longer\\ndesignated as a dangerous organization. Additionally, Meta recognized\\nthat regardless of the Azov Regiment\\'s designation, this post falls\\nunder the exception that allows references to dangerous individuals and\\norganizations when discussing the human rights of individuals and\\nmembers of designated entities.\\n\\n## Board Authority and Scope\\n\\nThe Board has authority to review Meta\\'s decision following an appeal\\nfrom the person whose content was removed (Charter Article 2, Section 1;\\nBylaws Article 3, Section 1).\\n\\nWhen Meta acknowledges that it made an error and reverses its decision\\non a case under consideration for Board review, the Board may select\\nthat case for a summary decision (Bylaws Article 2, Section 2.1.3). The\\nBoard reviews the original decision to increase understanding of the\\ncontent moderation processes involved, reduce errors and increase\\nfairness for Facebook and Instagram users.\\n\\n## Case Significance\\n\\nThis case highlights shortcomings in the updating of Meta\\'s Dangerous\\nOrganizations and Individuals list and its enforcement, which raises\\ngreater concerns during times of war. The case also illustrates the\\nsystemic challenges in enforcing exceptions to Meta\\'s policy on\\nDangerous Organizations and Individuals.\\n\\nPreviously, the Board issued a recommendation stating that Meta\\'s\\nDangerous Organizations and Individuals policy should allow users to\\ndiscuss alleged human rights abuses of members of dangerous\\norganizations ( [Öcalan\\'s\\nIsolation](https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/ig-i9dp23ib/) decision, recommendation no. 5),\\nwhich Meta committed to implement. Furthermore, the Azov Regiment was\\nremoved from Meta\\'s Dangerous Organizations and Individuals list in\\nJanuary 2023. The Board has issued a recommendation stating that, when\\nany new policy is adopted, internal guidance and training should be\\nprovided to content moderators ( [Öcalan\\'s\\nIsolation](https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/ig-i9dp23ib/) decision, recommendation no. 8).\\nThe Board has also issued recommendations on the enforcement accuracy of\\nMeta\\'s policies by calling for further transparency regarding\\nenforcement error rates on the \"praise\" and \"support\" of dangerous\\nindividuals and organizations ( [Öcalan\\'s\\nIsolation](https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/ig-i9dp23ib/) decision, recommendation no.\\n12), and the implementation of an internal audit procedure to learn from\\npast automated enforcement mistakes ( [Breast Cancer Symptoms and\\nNudity](https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/ig-7thr3si1/) decision, recommendation no. 5).\\nFully implementing these recommendations could help Meta decrease the\\nnumber of similar content moderation errors.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\nThe Board overturns Meta\\'s original decision to remove the content. The\\nBoard acknowledges Meta\\'s correction of its initial error once the Board\\nbrought the case to Meta\\'s attention.\\n\\n'</span>,\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **The Problem**\n",
    "Traditional vector stores only embed the main content, leaving rich metadata unsearchable:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional approach - metadata trapped\n",
    "record.content = \"Long text...\"        # → Gets embedded ✅\n",
    "record.metadata.summary = \"Key points\"  # → Not searchable ❌\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Our Solution: Enhanced Record with Configuration-Driven Multi-Field Embeddings**\n",
    "The enhanced Record class provides direct vector processing capabilities:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# conf/storage/osb.yaml\n",
    "osb_vector:\n",
    "  type: chromadb\n",
    "  # ... basic config\n",
    "  multi_field_embedding:\n",
    "    content_field: \"content\"\n",

    "      - source_field: \"summary\"\n",
    "        chunk_type: \"summary\"\n",
    "        min_length: 50\n",

    "        chunk_type: \"title\"\n",
    "        min_length: 10\n",
    "```\n",

    "| **Hybrid** | Semantic + exact match | `query + where={\"case_number\": \"2024\"}` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ **Benefits**\n",
    "- ✅ **Enhanced Record**: Direct vector capabilities built into Record class\n",
    "- ✅ **Configuration-Driven**: No hardcoded field names\n",
    "- ✅ **Data Source Agnostic**: Works with any Record structure\n",
    "- ✅ **Same Config**: Creation and reading use identical configuration\n",
    "- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new field types for any dataset"

    "\n",
    "The vector database now includes smart cache management to prevent overwriting local changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Solved**\n",
    "Previously, re-running embedding cells would download the remote ChromaDB cache and overwrite any local changes, losing newly added embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution: Smart Cache Management**\n",
    "The system now includes intelligent cache handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def _smart_cache_management(self, remote_path: str) -> Path:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Smart cache management that prevents overwriting newer local changes.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check if local cache was recently modified (within 1 hour)\n",
    "    if time_since_modified < 3600:  # 1 hour\n",
    "        logger.info(\"🔒 Skipping download to preserve local changes\")\n",
    "        return cache_path\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Only download if cache is stale\n",
    "    logger.info(\"🔄 Syncing remote ChromaDB\")\n",
    "    return await ensure_chromadb_cache(remote_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Automatic Sync-Back**\n",
    "After successful embedding operations, local changes are automatically synced to remote storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def _sync_local_changes_to_remote(self) -> None:\n",

    "        logger.info(\"✅ Successfully synced local changes to remote storage\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits**\n",
    "- ✅ **Prevents Data Loss**: Local embedding work is preserved\n",
    "- ✅ **Automatic Sync**: Changes are pushed back to remote storage  \n",
    "- ✅ **Time-Based Logic**: Only acts on recently modified caches\n",
