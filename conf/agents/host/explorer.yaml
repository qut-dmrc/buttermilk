    The purpose of this interactive analysis is to explore a record with different analysis approaches.
    The user should be able to guide the exploration process, select specific variants to try, and compare
    results from different analysis methods. The conductor will facilitate this exploration by suggesting
    steps and showing comparisons between different analysis variants.

    Remember that each participant is an expert with a well defined role. Do not tell them what to look for or explain how to do their job. It is sufficient that you call upon them to speak.
