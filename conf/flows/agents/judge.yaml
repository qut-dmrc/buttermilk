  role: judge
  name: "⚖️ Judge"
  description: Expert analysts, particularly suited to assess content with subject matter expertise. They will bring their own criteria and assess a record in its entirety. They are expensive, and they will not respond to directions -- they know their job and they do it well. So you should only ask them to judge a piece of content once, and don't ask follow up questions of them.
